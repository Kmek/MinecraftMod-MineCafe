### Note
All textures and models are custom-made by me. 
They cannot be used elsewhere for free. 
They cannot be used elsewhere without permission from me. 
You must consult with me before you use any of my mod's assets.

## Compatability
- Compiled with JEI for crafting recipe support
- Currently focusing on Minecraft 1.19.3 (will work on backporting when I have more time)
